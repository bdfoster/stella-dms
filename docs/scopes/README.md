## Scopes
StellaDMS uses scopes to define access levels granted to a specific `user` or `client`.
A scope is a combination of a resource type, action class, and optionally a resource identifier.
Each resource type has a defined set of action classes, and optionally those action classes
can be specific to a resource. Scopes take the format of:
```
<RESOURCE_TYPE>:<ACTION_CLASS>[:<RESOURCE_ID>]
```
For example, an account that is given a `user:read` scope can read `user` resource 
types in the system through the User API. However, an account that is given a 
`user:read:bdfoster` scope can only get the information of a particular `user`
(in this case, the user with an ID of `bdfoster`). If an account has both `user:read` and 
`user:read:bdfoster` scopes, the less-restrictive scope prevails (i.e.: `user:read`), meaning
that the account can read any `user` account's data.

All API endpoints are associated with a particular scope. Scopes which map to an endpoint containing `:id`
will respect the optional resource identifier (`RESOURCE_ID`, the third section in the scope).

A wildcard (`*`) can also be used to define a scope encompassing *all* action classes.
